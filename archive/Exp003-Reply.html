W. Chai, H. Y. Li, X. H. Xiao, J. Y. Huang, and S. N. Luo, manuscript No. SMM-19-733.</p>
<p>&emsp;We appreciate the constructive remarks by the referee and have revised the manuscript accordingly. The comments raised are all addressed as follows. The revision details are marked in red in the revised manuscript. </p>
<h3 id="Reviewer-1"><a href="#Reviewer-1" class="headerlink" title="Reviewer #1"></a>Reviewer #1</h3><p>&emsp;This work investigates deformation dynamics in closed-cell foam of polymethacrylimide under uniaxial compression with in situ x-ray computed tomography and digital volume correlation. It is an interesting topic which it has to more study. The paper is good and well-written, but some issues have to be explained better.</p>
<ol>
<li>What is the difference to calculate mechanical properties in 2D or in 3D system?</li>
</ol>
<p><font color=Blue>Response</font>: It is common to analyze mechanical properties of foams in 2D, e.g. via scanning electron microscopy. However, the microstructures of real foam materials are 3D in nature. There are distinct differences in quantification of the relative density, cell size, cell morphology and cell wall thickness of foams between the 2D and 3D systems, so 3D calculations of mechanical properties should be used if possible.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Could Voronoi systems be phenomenological models for representing these morphologies?</li>
</ol>
<p><font color=Blue>Response</font>: Yes, to some extent. The 3D Voronoi technique (<font color=Blue>Okabe et al., 1992</font>) has been widely employed to generate closed-cell foams with irregular cells. It is useful for investigating the effects of structural parameters on the mechanical properties of foams. However, the Voronoi foam system cannot reproduce two characteristics of a real foam: the thickness distribution of walls, and the thickness variations along walls and between walls and edges. In a Voronoi system, wall thickness is normally constant across the sample, and is equal to the edge thickness.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>What is the real perspective of this approach?</li>
</ol>
<p><font color=Blue>Response</font>: Edge segmentation separates the initial structure of a foam sample into two parts, i.e., edges and walls. The edge and wall morphologies can be quantified, and used to predict deformation processes (e.g., location and temporal sequence of deformation banding) and collapse strength of a foam. They also serve a basis for tailoring local strength and energy absorption of foams. Combined with finite element method analysis, foam structure can be manipulated to study the effect of local heterogeneity or defects on foam deformation. Clarification has been made in the last paragraph.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>Is it possible to perform a calculation based on beam elastic deformation?</li>
</ol>
<p><font color=Blue>Response</font>: Not in our case. For open-cell foams or some closed-cell foams with large edge volume fractions, the calculation of mechanical properties based on elastic deformation of beams is appropriate. The mechanical support comes mainly from the edges in these foams. However, tomographic images in our case show that cell collapse is generally preceded by elastic buckling of cell walls. The solid fraction of edges in our foams is much lower than that of conventional polymer foams with curved, thin cell walls. Such a difference contributes to the difference in the dominant deformation modes during the collapse stage. Clarification has been made in line 1–5, paragraph 2, page 3, and line 17–23, paragraph 2, page 4.</p>
<ol start="5">
<li>Is it possible to consider Fig. 3a as a system of beams?</li>
</ol>
<p><font color=Blue>Response</font>: Fig. 3a actually shows a $xy$-slice of the tomographic image, and is a cross-section of a 3D structure. In this slice, cell walls become lines while edges become corners or lines (for edges parallel to the $xy$-plane). So it is inappropriate to considered it as a system of beams. Clarification has been made in line 1–3, paragraph 1, page 4.</p>
<ol start="6">
<li>Is tomography representative for studying mechanical properties?</li>
</ol>
<p><font color=Blue>Response</font>: Yes in our case. A previous study (<font color=Blue>Andrews et al., 2001</font>) showed that the mechanical properties of foams are independent of sample size when it is six times greater than the average cell size in both the horizontal and longitudinal directions. Our sample contains over 10 cell layers in both directions and the mechanical properties obtained from tomography are representative. Clarification has been made in line 8–9, the last paragraph, page 1, and line 1, paragraph 1, page 2.</p>
<ol start="7">
<li>How could be solved the homogeneity problem?</li>
</ol>
<p><font color=Blue>Response</font>: See the reply to the preceding comment. In addition, this can also be verified by a good repeatability of stress–strain curves between different samples.</p>
<ol start="8">
<li>Graphical Abstract is not appropriate. It must be more explanatory and immediate.</li>
</ol>
<p><font color=Blue>Response</font>: Thanks for your suggestion. The graphical abstract has been revised.</p>
<h3 id="Reviewer-2"><a href="#Reviewer-2" class="headerlink" title="Reviewer #2"></a>Reviewer #2</h3><p>&emsp;The limitation of the well-known empirical relationships between mechanical properties and relative density of cellular solids [1] has been realised and overcome through taking account of morphological parameters of individual or collective cells for more accurate structure-property correlation [12, 14]. However, these cell-level parameters are not directly linked to the deformation mechanism of base material. Recently, cell-wall parameters have been demonstrated to determine the compressive strength of a virtual 2D foam [<font color=Blue>Materials Sci. Eng. A 688 (2017), 27-39</font>], but no similar work has yet been reported for an actual 3D foam. In such a context, the study presented in this manuscript is a good and timely contribution to the progress in this research field. The manuscript is well written and the characterisation method is solid. The reviewer suggests the following aspects be revised to strengthen the analysis.</p>
<ul>
<li>Fig. 4 shows the distribution of cells with strength index smaller than 0.0037. However, these cells are not fully connected within each band that is indicated in Fig. 4b. In other words, the neighbour cells of the filtered cells within the indicated band have strength index larger than 0.0037, but they are excluded when evaluating the probability to form a band. This treatment is not appropriate, since the cause of the localised deformation band is the collective weakness of all the cells within the band rather than the inclusion of some weak cells in the band. Therefore, the authors should also calculate the strength index values for all the cells within each observed band (i.e. E1, E2, E3, E4 or E5, as shown in Fig. 2a) and then compare the averaged strength index values between different observed bands.</li>
</ul>
<p><font color=Blue>Response</font>: We think that deformation band nucleation is dominated by the weakest cell walls in the band, rather than by the average strength of all walls. The axial stress is uniformly distributed on cell walls and edges across the sample section. When the stress reaches the critical buckling strength of the weakest cell walls, they buckle and change the mechanical (stress, support) state of their neighbors, making these cell walls fragile. The tomographic images also show that buckling occurs firstly in some (rather than all) cell walls in a band, and “propagates” to other walls, rendering all cells in the band collapse approximately at the same time.<br>&emsp;The average values of the buckling strength index for five observed bands (E1–E5) are 0.092, 0.820, 0.137, 0.242 and 0.294, respectively. The results are inconsistent with the temporal sequence of deformation banding, and cannot predict a collapse strength comparable to the experimental measurement. In fact, the cell walls are randomly oriented and those (nearly) perpendicular to the loading direction have large strength indices. These walls can increase the average value of strength index in a band. In addition, the deformation bands are not strictly perpendicular to the loading direction (inclination angle $4^\circ-10^\circ$). Averaging across the sample section along the loading direction or sample height may smooth out the strength index distribution.</p>
<ul>
<li>The authors should attempt to obtain the axial distribution of strength index. A plot for strength index similar to the plot for Minkowski anisotropic index (Fig. S1) should be added.</li>
</ul>
<p><font color=Blue>Response</font>: The distribution of the average buckling strength index of cell walls along the sample height is shown in Fig.R1. The curve from averaging all walls exhibits very large oscillations and does not show clearly the weak zones in the foam sample. Since the walls (nearly) perpendicular to the loading direction have large strength indices, we apply a filter process to exclude walls with $\beta&lt;30^\circ$ ($\beta$ the angle between the loading direction and a wall normal). The wall with a higher $\beta$ is more prone to buckle.<br>&emsp;In this way, the oscillations are reduced, but the distribution curve still does not show obvious features of deformation banding, compared to the 3D distribution of weakest walls. The probable reason is that the deformation bands are not strictly perpendicular to the loading direction (especially band E3). Averaging on the strength index of cell walls across the sample section along the height direction is not appropriate to probe the weak zones of foam sample. This may also be responsible for why the distribution of the Minkowski anisotropic index cannot predict deformation banding.</p>

<font size=2px>Fig.R1: Distribution of the average buckling strength index $\lambda_{\rm w}$ of cell walls along the sample height direction. Each data point is averaged within a $200\mu m$ segment along the height direction. $\beta$ is the angle between the loading direction and a wall normal. The wall with a higher $\beta$ value is more prone to buckle.</font>

<ul>
<li>Undoubtedly, structure-property correlation based on 3D quantification of the cell walls is more accurate and reliable than that based on 2D structural data. However, 3D data is not always accessible while 2D data can be easily obtained via processing cross-sectional images. Therefore, it is of practical value and interest to evaluate the usefulness of 2D analysis, but such evaluation cannot be possible without 3D results as reference. Given the established 3D correlation by the authors, the reviewer suggests the authors also perform a 2D correlation based on the CT slices and then address the limitation of the 2D analysis. It is indeed necessary because sometimes 2D and 3D analyses may lead to same conclusions (e.g. same location of the weakest site).</li>
</ul>
<p><font color=Blue>Response</font>: The 2D analyses can provide a preliminary estimation of the cell size and solid fraction of foams. In terms of the cell wall thickness, 2D and 3D structural data can give similar results. If cell wall strength is controlled mainly by wall thickness, 2D and 3D analyses may lead to similar conclusions, as demonstrated in the previous work (<font color=Blue>Sun et al., 2017</font>).<br>&emsp;However, the width and height of cell walls cannot be accessed simultaneously in 2D analyses. The width and height distributions of cell walls from 2D analyses are also quite different from those in 3D analyses. Therefore, the 2D analysis is not appropriate for quantifying the cell wall strength in our case. In fact, it is impossible to accurately quantify local structural parameters in two dimensions, which hinders a full understanding of the cell strength of foam samples. In addition, the 2D analyses may lead to different conclusions in different sections.</p>
<ul>
<li>In the caption of Figure 1, “color-coding refers to axial strain” should be “color-coding refers to increments of axial strain”. The crushed cells at a nominal strain of 0.5 (Fig. 1b) are indicated in red which corresponds to a value of zero, so the color code cannot be based on absolute strain.</li>
</ul>
<p><font color=Blue>Response</font>: Thanks for your suggestion. Correction has been made in the caption of Fig.1.</p>
<ul>
<li>The authors could include greater reference to previous work on X-ray imaging of the deformation behaviour of cellular materials and foams, particularly in situ measurements of the deformation.</li>
</ul>
<p><font color=Blue>Response</font>: Thanks for your suggestion. We have added more references on this topic; see Refs. [13], [18] and [27] in the revised manuscript.</p>
